# React + Vite

- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Additional Features

- Provides basic create, read, update, and delete example routes via services using Axios. 
These routes are meant to be called from react pages and components. Fetached data is designed
to be stored in an application state where the data is then validated and used by react
components and pages.

- Page router and mobx - needs additional documentation.
